#Non-redundant motif indentification in Maize data set 
This YRB`_`Maize repository contains our work to implement a simple work flow for Maize CAGE data from this paper [Mej√≠a-Guerra MK, Li W, Galeano NF, et al. Core Promoter Plasticity Between Maize Tissues and Genotypes Contrasts with Predominance of Sharp Transcription Initiation Sites. The Plant Cell. 2015;27(12):3309-3320. doi:10.1105/tpc.15.00630.](http://www.plantcell.org/content/early/2015/11/30/tpc.15.00630.short?rss=1)

#Raw data 
The orignial paper described their 4 CAGE samples: 2 for shoots tissue and 2 for roots tissue. After analyzing the tag data for these 4 samples. It is strange that shoot_1 and shoot_2 share few common tags. We thought these samples may be not good for our following motif identification since the biological duplicate should highly relavant to each other like root_1 and root_2.

#Our analysis
In order to identfiy non-redudant motifs near promoter region in Maize root tissue. We implemented our work flow which combinds cross-validation, de novo motif identification and graphical clustering.

I won't dicuss the details of implementation here which is described in my [log file](https://github.com/xianyao710/YRB_Capstone/blob/master/logs/6-14.md)

The results using original homer,tomtom parameters are weird because in theory we should expect motifs that were observed in each of the 9 training groups. These motifs should be clustered regardless of their postion in training group. At first, we suspected that it might be the parameters that affect clustering result, so we filtered homer result with e-value< 1e-20 and used tomtom threshold e-value = 0.01,0.001,0.001(false discovery rate).
